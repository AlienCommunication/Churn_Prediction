Customer churn is the action of the
customer who is like to leave the company and it is one of
the mounting issues of today’s rapidly growing and
competitive telecommunication industry. To minimize the
customer churn, prediction activity to be an important part of
the telecommunication industry’s vital decision making and
strategic planning process.
 world. Telecommunication market is facing a severe loss
of revenue due to increasing competition among them and
loss of potential customers [1]. Churn is the activity of the
telecommunication industry is the customers leaving the
current company and moving to another telecom company.
Many companies are finding the reasons of losing customers
by measuring customer loyalty to regain the lost customers.
To keep up with the competition and to acquire as many
customers, most operators invest a huge amount of revenue
to expand their business in the beginning 

# Objective
The main objective of this research is to produce a
predictive model with better results that assess customer
churn rate of telecommunication companies using the
predictive analytics algorithm for data mining. 

# METHODOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Data mining and statistical algorithms were used in the
data analysis, model building and model deployment in this
Project.

# Data Collection
The questionnaire was used as the tool to collect the data
primarily from customers. The Google drive plug-in was
used to design the questionnaire. Training data was collected
from the 200 respondents and 50 responses were received
from respondents on the questionnaire for testing data.

# Data Pre-processing
The training and testing dataset used in this Project may
be included missing data, repeated data or inconsistent data.
To handling missing data and removing duplicated data
values data pre-processing is done. For understanding the Statistics of the data
I used Pandas profing to get EDA done in just one line, Used one Hot encoding to encode the categorical data into Numerical
